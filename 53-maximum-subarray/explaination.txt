Kadane’s Intuition (Short & Complete)
You move through the array while keeping a running sum of your current subarray.
If this running sum ever becomes negative, it will always hurt any future subarray you try to build.
(Because adding a negative prefix to anything positive makes it smaller.)
So the moment your running sum goes negative, you discard it completely and start a new subarray from the next element.
All the while, you track the maximum running sum you’ve seen at any point — that’s the best subarray.
